    "Problem 1: In order to retrieve all AGI Locus Codes from files \"Germplasm.tsv\" and \"LocusGene.tsv\", a function named \"AGI_Locus_code_compiler()\" has been created. This function takes two argument. The first one (which is called \"file_name\") must be a string and must equal the name of the file it is wanted to read. Second argument (which is called \"separator\") must be a string representing the separator character from the read file containing rows and columns (for instance, tsv and csv files have this structure). In this case, since a tsv file is being read, \"\\t\" separator will be used. This function returns a list of all AGI Locus codes from one single file. Finally, a condition is represented so both AGI Locus codes lists are compared. AGI_Locus_code_compiler() allows to extract every AGI Locus Code from this kind of files, despite where it is located in the file line or row. This is due to the utilisation of regular expressions."

    "Problem 2: First, a database for this exam has been created using MySQL commands. In this problem, four different functions have been used. These functions are: \"CONNECT()\", \"tsv_and_csv_reader()\", \"create_table_command()\", and \"sql_command()\". Functions and variables nomenclature does not coincide with Python general conventions (for example, unmodifiable variables are uppercase, etc.). CONNECT() just takes a database name as a string as its argument. It returns a value needed for Python database manipulation commands. tsv_and_csv_reader() was created to solve exercises previous to this exam. It takes four different arguments: \"file_name\" (a string that equals the name of the file that is wanted to be read), \"split_sign\" (a string representing the separator character from the read file that is necessary to be indicated), \"keep_lines_as_lists\" (a boolean value that will decide if function output becomes either a list containing multiple lists, each one of them representing one line from the read file, or a single string), and separator (if \"keep_lines_as_lists\" value equals True, then this argument can equal any string; if \"keep_lines_as_lists\" value equals False, this string argument will be intercalated into the output single string file words). Thus, tsv_and_csv_reader() returns either a sublists list or a single string, both containing all the information from read file. This function became really useful for this problems solving, especially due to the sublists list output. create_table_command() just returns a string equal to a \"CREATE TABLE\" command from MySQL, considering new table name argument as a string, and the extracted table header from a read file which will be its second argument in the form of a sublists list (tsv_and_csv_reader() is needed right here). This \"CREATE TABLE\" command dictate column creation either containing the primary key values or variable character values. Finally, sql_command() takes two argument, which are the value output by CONNECT() function as it first argument and a string equaling a MySQL command, which in this case will come from create_table_command(). sql_command() just executes changes in the chosen database. This funciton combination allow to create any table by indicating just the database name, the file name and the separator used in that kind of file."

    "Problem 4: writer() and checker() functions were retrieved from suggested problems previous to this exam, as well as SQL_TABLE_READER() function. writer() takes the file name you are editing as a string argument, a string containing the information you want to add to your edited file and a string argument which will represent if it is wanted to write from scratch (\"w\") or to append (\"a\") the information given by the string argument containing the information you want to add to a file. checker() just takes a file name as a string as its argument and will show the information that it contains. SQL_TABLE_READER() takes CONNECT() returned value as a argument, as well as a MySQL query command in form of an input string and a column separator as a string. This function will return a string containing the information retrieved from a database. In essence, the arguments needed in order to do so are the database name, a MySQL query command and a column separator (e. g., \"\\t\" and \",\"). Especific MySQL query commands from this language have been used: IN operator was used to retrive a multiple single lines query (i. e., in this case, an output where only rows with gene names \"SKOR\" and \"MAA3\" were shown); and LIKE operator and MySQL regular expressions were utilized for retrieving chromosomes genes information. Thus, explicit information from orignal files had to be known in order to query. However, through the original file reading, this information could have been extracted without even knowning about database tables headers if a solution similar to that from problem 1 (just searching for a sequence of charaacters) had been given (which would have been a more abstracted solution)."
